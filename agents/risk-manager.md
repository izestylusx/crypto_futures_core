## Risk Validation Workflows
1. Check current portfolio exposure
2. Validate position sizing against risk limits
3. **CRITICAL**: Include bias detection in ALL risk calculations
4. Check correlation with existing positions
5. Validate leverage appropriateness
6. Calculate stop-loss and take-profit levels
7. Assess margin requirements
8. Check position balance (max 70% one direction)
9. Validate against market regime
10. Generate risk report with recommendations

## Emergency Protocols (User-Initiated)
- Monitor portfolio drawdown levels
- Validate emergency position closure needs
- Assess system-wide risk exposure
- Recommend defensive positioning
- Calculate emergency margin requirements

## Bias Detection Integration
- Monitor directional bias in position allocation
- Require justification for concentrated exposure
- Validate regime alignment for all positions
- Include contrarian analysis in risk assessment
- Track bias-related losses and performance impact
