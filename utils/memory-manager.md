## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SAFETY WARNING

**üö® NEVER USE CACHED DATA FOR TRADING DECISIONS**
- Cache is for LEARNING and SESSION CONTINUITY only
- ALL trading decisions must use FRESH real-time MCP data
- Crypto markets move every second - cached prices are DANGEROUS
- Always call fresh MCP tools before any trade execution

## Cache Update Commands

### Session Learning Cache (SAFE)
```yaml
update_session_learning_cache:
  purpose: "Record analysis process and outcomes for learning"
  trigger: "After analysis completion (NOT during live trading)"
  safety_rule: "Contains NO real-time price data"
  process:
    1. "Save analysis reasoning and methodology"
    2. "Record strategy used and confidence level"
    3. "Note market conditions at time of analysis"
    4. "Track decision process for future learning"
    
  example_prompt: |
    "Save analysis learning to session cache:
    1. Record: 'BTCUSDT analysis at 14:30 - identified bull flag pattern'
    2. Method: 'Used RSI + volume analysis'
    3. Confidence: '78% based on historical similar setups'
    4. Outcome: 'Recommended long entry - monitoring for results'
    ‚ö†Ô∏è NO PRICE DATA cached - analysis process only"
```

### Strategy Performance Cache (SAFE)
```yaml
update_strategy_performance_cache:
  purpose: "Track strategy success rates over time"
  trigger: "After trade outcomes are known"
  safety_rule: "Historical performance only, no current prices"
  process:
    1. "Update strategy win/loss statistics"
    2. "Record which market conditions worked best"
    3. "Note timing and session patterns"
    4. "Calculate performance metrics"
    
  example_prompt: |
    "Update strategy performance cache:
    1. Strategy: 'Trend following' Result: 'Success (+2.3%)'
    2. Conditions: 'High volume breakout during US session'
    3. Update stats: 'Now 78% win rate over 25 trades'
    ‚ö†Ô∏è NO current prices - performance tracking only"
```

### Token Profile Updates
```yaml
update_token_profile_command:
  trigger: "After analyzing any specific token"
  process:
    1. "Load existing token profile or create from template"
    2. "Update technical characteristics based on new analysis"
    3. "Add new support/resistance levels if identified"
    4. "Update strategy performance data"
    
  example_prompt: |
    "Update BTCUSDT token profile:
    1. Open cache/tokens/BTCUSDT-profile.md (or create from token-template.md)
    2. Update current_market_data section with latest price data
    3. Add any new support/resistance levels identified
    4. Update technical_characteristics based on today's analysis
    5. Add this analysis to analysis_history section
    6. Save updated profile"
```
